1. Installation
First create configure script and other things needed by autoconf and automake by running:
	autoreconf -i

Now you can configure project by running:
	./configure
	
Configuration script should find proper C and C++ compilers for MPI itself (if they are in a PATH), but if not you can set them by providing CC=<path to mpicc> e.g.
	./configure CC=<path to mpicc>

Now build project by running:
	make

If you wish you may install dynamic library and examples by running:
	make install
